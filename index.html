             Bruce Lee is widely regarded as one of the most influential and famous martial artists of all time. He is also widely known as the greatest icon of martial arts cinema and a key figure of modern
              popular culture .Lee's films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level and sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts in the West. Lee also became iconic to Chinese, 
              as he portrayed Chinese national pride and Chinese nationalism in his movies. His pioneering efforts paved the way for future martial artists and martial arts actors such as Jackie Chan, Jet Li and 
              Chuck Norris, bringing martial arts films and actors to the mainstream .Bruce Lee's evaluation of traditional martial arts doctrines is nowadays seen as one of the first steps into the modern style
              of mixed martial arts. Dana White, President of UFC, has referred to Lee as the "father of mixed martial arts".</p></section>

        <p class="leg">With the posthumous release of Enter the Dragon, Lee's status as a film icon was confirmed. The film, said to have a budget of $1 million, went on to gross more than $200 million. 
        <br>Lee's legacy helped pave the way for broader depictions of Asian Americans in cinema and created a whole new breed of action hero a mold filled with varying degrees of success by actors like Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and Jackie Chan.
        <br>Lee's life has been depicted in the 1993 film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, based on the 1975 Linda Lee memoir Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew, and the 2009 documentary How Bruce Lee Changed the World.
